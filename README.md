# Weather Application

Takes in a location, spits out the next 3 days weather for it. <br>
This is a remake of the <a href="https://github.com/Vebriclya/odin-weather-app">weather app</a> (see live version <a href="https://vebriclya.github.io/odin-weather-app/">here</a>) I made for the Odin Project. <br>
Wanted to see how much easier it was to write in HTMX. Spoiler - _a lot_.

### To Do

- Maybe add optional music?
